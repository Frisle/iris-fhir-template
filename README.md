## intersystems-fhirserver-template
Base template for using InterSystems IRIS for Health Community Edition as a FHIR Server

It setups a FHIR SERVER, imports the test data, demoes REST API usage with a simple web page.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 

Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-fhir-template.git
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing FHIR R4 API

Open URL http://localhost:32783/fhir/r4/metadata
you should see the output of fhir resources on this server

## Testing Postman calls

Open Postman and make a GET call for the preloaded Patient:
http://localhost:32783/fhir/r4/Patient/1

## Testing FHIR API calls in simple frontend APP

the very basic frontend app with search and get calls to Patient and Observation FHIR resources could be found here:
http://localhost:32783/csp/user/fhirUI/FHIRAppDemo.html

## How to start coding
This repository is ready to code in VSCode with ObjectScript plugin.
Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and [ObjectScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript) plugin and open the folder in VSCode.
Open /src/cls/PackageSample/ObjectScript.cls class and try to make changes - it will be compiled in running IRIS docker container.
![docker_compose](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2781759/76656929-0f2e5700-6547-11ea-9cc9-486a5641c51d.gif)

Feel free to delete PackageSample folder and place your ObjectScript classes in a form
/src/Package/Classname.cls
[Read more about folder setup for InterSystems ObjectScript](https://community.intersystems.com/post/simplified-objectscript-source-folder-structure-package-manager)

The script in Installer.cls will import everything you place under /src into IRIS.


## What's inside the repository

### Dockerfile

The simplest dockerfile which starts IRIS and imports Installer.cls and then runs the Installer.setup method, which creates IRISAPP Namespace and imports ObjectScript code from /src folder into it.
Use the related docker-compose.yml to easily setup additional parametes like port number and where you map keys and host folders.
Use .env/ file to adjust the dockerfile being used in docker-compose.


### .vscode/settings.json

Settings file to let you immedietly code in VSCode with [VSCode ObjectScript plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript))

### .vscode/launch.json
Config file if you want to debug with VSCode ObjectScript
